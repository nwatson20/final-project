			<p>Hello! I am an illustrator and fiber artist with a particular interest in unconventional visual storytelling. I love using my art as a part of everyday communication online, whether it be through posting online, sharing silly doodles with friends, or celebrating a shared passion for games and movies. This is why I'm always keeping any eye out for new online zine projects to contribute to. It's important to me that we keep independent art alive by supporting eachother in these grassroots projects.</p>
			<p>I chose to archive my portfolio in a personal website rather than the typical Google Drive folder because I am still hopelessly in love with the old days of the world-wide-web: nostalgia is an important facet of my art, whether it be shown through subject matter, aesthetics, construction, or any combination of the three. I'm just getting started with the web revival movement, which seeks to revive the art of virtual worlds and personal homepages. Please take your time as you look around. Complementary tea and cookies are included.</p>
